Hi, I'm Zikun Ye. I am an Assistant Professor of Marketing at the Michael G. Foster School of Business, University of Washington.

My research focuses on developing and leveraging data-driven optimization algorithms, field experiments, causal inference, and machine learning to evaluate and optimize strategies in the contexts of digital platforms and marketplaces.

Before joining the Foster School of Business, I earned my Ph.D. in Operations Research at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in 2023 and my Bachelor's in Mathematics and Engineering with Zhiyuan honors from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2018. 


<!---My primary research focuses on data-driven optimization and causal inference with applications in platform operations and revenue management. The goal is to provide actionable policies and operations for online platforms. I’ve had the pleasure of working with platform companies including Kwai, Walmart Global Tech, LIVAD Technology, and DiDi.
