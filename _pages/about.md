I am an Assistant Professor of Marketing at the [Michael G. Foster School of Business](https://foster.uw.edu/) at the University of Washington.

My research focuses on developing and leveraging generative AI, LLMs, causal machine learning, and field experiments to improve business decision making. More recently, I am interested in LLM-powered market research through better framework designs.

Before joining the Foster School of Business, I earned my Ph.D. in Operations Research from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2023 and my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Engineering with Zhiyuan honors from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2018.
