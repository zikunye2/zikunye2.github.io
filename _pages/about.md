Hi, I'm Zikun Ye. I am an Assistant Professor of Marketing at the Michael G. Foster School of Business, University of Washington.

My research focuses on developing and leveraging data-driven tools, including generative AI, causal machine learning, and field experiments to evaluate and optimize strategies in digital platforms and marketplaces.

Before joining the Foster School of Business, I earned my Ph.D. in Operations Research from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2023 and my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Engineering with honors from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2018. 

<!---I'm looking for research assistants with a strong computational or mathematical background. Interested candidates are encouraged to email me their resumes and transcripts. --->

<!---My primary research focuses on data-driven optimization and causal inference with applications in platform operations and revenue management. The goal is to provide actionable policies and operations for online platforms. I’ve had the pleasure of working with platform companies including Kwai, Walmart Global Tech, LIVAD Technology, and DiDi.
